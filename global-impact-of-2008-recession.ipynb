Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n\nThis project will look at how the world was impacted by the 2008 recession with the two primary focuses will be on the economy and crime. Each country's GDP growth rate will serve as a proxy for their economic condition and intentional homicide rate per 100,000 will be used as a measure for crime rate. The scope of the analysis will be both on a regional and national level. The data comes from the dataset [\"World Development Indicators\"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/world-development-indicators) uploaded by Kaggle user Batucan Senkal.

Conclusion <a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n\nFrom the results, we can see the majority of the 2008 recession's impact was economic. Nations worldwide were impacted greatly, especially North America as well as Western Europe. The effect was nowhere near as great in regards to crime. There was little to no change for the majority of regions. It is possible there were other crime statistics that would have shown more significant results, as there are many more types of crimes than just intentional homicide. In the future, I would like to investigate which types of crimes are most dependent on a nation's economic condition. Maybe petty crimes such as pickpocketing become more common as people start struggling more financially. Another topic that would be interesting to investigate would be how different recessions vary in impact. Comparing the 2008 recession to the recession caused by COVID-19 may yield vastly different results. ","metadata":{}}]}
